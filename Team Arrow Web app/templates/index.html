              <h3>Agriculture</h3>
              <p>Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the economy of 
                Telangana and the better performance of this sector is vital 
                for inclusive growth. Agriculture is a way of life, a tradition 
                that has shaped the culture and economic life of the people 
                of Telangana. Therefore, it will continue to be central to all 
                strategies for planned socio-economic development of the 
                State. Maximum production is seen Warangal-Rural 
                District.</p>

                 <p>The category chosen is Zero Hunger and prompt selected 
                    for analysis addresses few of the important elements 
                    effecting precision farming. Our analysis mainly focuses on 
                    the key factors like overall rainfall recorded with respect to 
                    each Mandal, overall seasonal yield in selected years, 
                    seasonal yield of major crops like Bengal gram, groundnut 
                    and maize, and overall yield in two different agricultural 
                    seasons: rabi and kharif.</p>

            <p class="con-1">The agricultural practices of Organic farming indulged within Telangana can act as a catalyst to increase the 
                    gross production of crops and their management. Current practices of Organic farming like- Protecting soil 
                    quality by using organic materials and encouraging biological activity. Indirect supply of crop nutrients by 
                    using soil microorganisms. Determination of nitrogen in the soil using pulses. Some organic methods like crop 
                    rotation, natural predators, and organic fertilizers are used for controlling weeds and pests. Step by step 
                    farming involves some substantial discourse- The first is crop selection, which means choosing the right crop 
                    according to the season. After that, some important points are land preparation; selecting the right seeds 
                    and sowing process, watering, and the addition of natural fertilizers. Other policies of Integrated farming 
                    must be introduced in a large scale to help with maximization of yield, Rejuvenation/amelioration of systems 
                    productivity and achieve agriculture-ecological equilibrium. Control the built-up of insects-pest, diseases and 
                    weeds while reducing the use of chemical fertilizer and other harmful agrochemicals and pesticides. 
                    Integrated farming techniques are extremely useful in the mitigation of negative impact of agriculture or 
                    livestock on environment.</p><br>
                
            
               <p class="con-2">Areas need to be emphasized are increasing the focus for small farm economy utilizing market 
                    intelligence along with the State Governments involvement in fixing the MSP. Strengthening 
                    National Agricultural Research system by allocating budget at least 3% of GSDP will give an 
                    impetus to the holistic crop production in the state with an overall ecosystem including various 
                    stakeholders and allied sectors. More emphasis for value addition and value chain 
                    management. I-Skill development through capacity building and disaster management as 
                    mentioned in NDMA may be further strengthened and real time mechanism to be evolved for 
                    relief measures through RS & GIS technologies can developed further.</p><br>
